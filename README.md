# WireHopper
A Grasshopper plugin for managing and customizing wire display and visibility.

## ✨ Features

#### 🔌Wire Display
Quickly toggle **Default**, **Faint**, **Hidden** and **Disconnect** wire modes across selected or all components. 

#### 🌳 Tree Operations
Apply **Flatten**, **Graft**, **Simplify**, or **Reverse** to all selected params — instantly.  
Manage multiple parameter access modes without diving into each one’s menu.

#### 🎨 Custom Themes
Customize Grasshopper’s wire colors and save your own **wire themes**.  
Restore or swap color schemes in a click.

#### 🔍 Flow Visualization
Trace full data flow upstream and downstream from any selected component.  
Isolate inputs or outputs to better understand dependencies.  
Visually debug your definition by hiding unrelated wires.

#### 🧹 Canvas Cleanup
Clean wires by 
- **Length**:  
  Automatically hide or simplify short, overlapping, or redundant wires that clutter the canvas.  
  Perfect for dense definitions where micro-connections make the graph hard to read.

- **Param Type**:  
  Filter and clean wires based on parameter type — e.g., geometry, number, text, or tree data.  
  Focus only on relevant data streams when debugging or documenting workflows.

- **Preview**:  
  Instantly show wires for all components with Component preview switched on

#### 💾 Saved Views (Per Document)
Store multiple **wire states** per Grasshopper document.  
Restore, update your saved wire layouts when reopening a file.  
Ideal for comparing alternate graph views or debugging stages
